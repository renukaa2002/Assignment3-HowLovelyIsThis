      <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
      <p>Did you know that cherry ice cream was first made in the early 1900s? It's a classic flavor loved by many! Cherries have been enjoyed for centuries, but it wasn't until the advent of modern refrigeration that cherry ice cream became widely popular. Today, it's a favorite treat that combines the sweet, tart flavor of cherries with the creamy richness of ice cream.</p>
      
      <p>Cherry ice cream isn't just delicious; it's also packed with health benefits! Cherries are a great source of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. They are known to have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce pain and swelling. Additionally, cherries contain melatonin, a natural sleep aid that can help improve the quality of your sleep.</p>
      
      <p>CherryNLove uses only the freshest cherries sourced from local farms, ensuring that each scoop is bursting with flavor. Our ice cream not only supports local agriculture but also helps reduce our environmental footprint by minimizing the distance our ingredients travel. It's a sweet choice that makes a difference!</p>
